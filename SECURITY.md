Any discovered vulnerabilityes will be addressed at https://web.lollypopstealer.net/vulnerabilty.html and
will be updated at least once a month. I run this by myself and any help to alleviate these vulnerabilyties
is appreciated so if you can solve them please create a pull request and I will review it and merge it if
