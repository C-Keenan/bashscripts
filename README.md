# This is a repo to showcase what I have learned about bash scripting and to house the useful, for me, scripts I have created. Please feel free to use them or change them as you need. NO WARRANTY is to be expected nor given and all use is left to the downloaders discretion. I did NOT force you to run the script so if there are any damages to your system they are on you for not understanding the script, I will however try to help you fix the problem if the scripts have been unaltered, though I am still learning about linux and it's ins and outs so I can't say I'll be much more help than using your favorite search engine to figure it out or completely starting from scratch. Always backup your data and do your best to follow the 3,2,1 backup method.

# Current uses

refreshtest.sh

This bash script only serves to update test.sh and delete the test.sh.1 file that is 
downloaded for the update.

test.sh

Currently only has some variables defined and nothing more so shouldn't do anything but
is the testbed for any scripts I am working on so run at YOUR OWN risk.
